# Far Away Swap
After the hackathon, I decided to continue working on Far Away Swap

## My missions

What I'm actually doing at Far Away is more about organising, management,
giving tasks, finding finances for the development. I can't say how,
but I use data-science for market studies, especially for concurrence. I analyze possible 
growth and revenue opportunities.
