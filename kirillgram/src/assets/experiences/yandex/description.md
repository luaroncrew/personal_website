# What I learned

I can't say what exactly I worked on at Yandex because I signed an NDA with them so if I give the precisions I can go
to russian Prison (a thing to avoid)

I was doing a lot of research on development so during this experience I got familiar with a
lot of technologies I had never used before. But what is more important - I became a professional googler. 
I really improved my capacity of information searching on web, filtering this information
as well as critical analysis of it.
